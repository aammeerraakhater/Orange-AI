    "What Is a Dockerizing\n",
    "\n",
    "Dockerizing is the process of packing, deploying, and running applications using Docker containers. Docker is an open source tool that ships your application with all the necessary functionalities as one package. You can use Docker to pack your application with everything you need to run the application (such as libraries) and ship it as one package - a container. Containers are created from images that specify their precise contents. Dockerizing is a big hit nowadays. All the big names use it - Google, VMware, or Amazon support it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parts of Docker:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Docker Engine - a portable packaging tool\n",
    "    The Docker Hub - cloud service for sharing applications\n",
    "\n",
    "The Docker container allows another user to quickly recreate the computer environment. The container provides operating virtualization by abstracting the “user space”. This technology ensures that your colleagues are developing or testing the product using the same environment as you which results in fewer errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Docker container technology was launched in 2013 by a startup Docker, Inc based in San Francisco, California. Docker, Inc became a “unicorn” company after a $95 million fundraising round in April 2015 (unicorn companies are privately held startups valued at over $1 billion).\n",

    "    Easy to use Docker simplified the way we deploy applications. You do not distribute the software as source code - you send the binary image of a part of your disk. It is easy to use for developers, system admins, architects, and others. It runs the application unmodified on any cloud. Docker also lets you use the Docker Hub, which contains tens of thousands of public images ready to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Fast\n",
    "    Docker containers are just sandboxed environments that run on the kernel. You can create and run the containers in seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Able to create a reproducible environment\n",
