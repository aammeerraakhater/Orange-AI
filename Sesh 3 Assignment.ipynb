Miniconda can be understood as a bootstrap, smaller version of Anaconda with just the Conda package management system and Python. After Miniconda distribution has been installed, you will have to install every package you require individually, using the Conda command.However, both Miniconda and Anaconda provide Conda as the default package manager."
