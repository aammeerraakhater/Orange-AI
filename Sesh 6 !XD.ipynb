    "\n",
    "The compiler is not responsible for deallocation of dynamically allocated objects. A user should always deallocate them. This is a matter of serious responsibility. If the dynamically allocated objects aren’t deallocated, it may lead to memory leaks.<br>\n",
    "for C++, dynamic memory deallocation has no practical disadvantage in most cases. C, on the other hand, has the issue that you need to manage deallocation correctly every time and that is really hard to do correctly in even a mildly complex code base.<br>\n",
    "2-extra memory is needed for the meta data used to track the allocated memory, and the risk of not having any memory available when needed.<br>\n",
    "3-The generic malloc/new allocator is fairly slow (~100ns per malloc/free or more on a modern machine), but you can always put a faster, non-generic allocator in front of it or at least batch your allocations a bit. The returned memory might have poor cache locality, but that can again be mitigated with a custom allocator or by batching your allocations. You have to pair mallocs with frees (news with deletes), but that can be automated (or for very small allocation, you can use alloca (which doesn’t have a matching freeing call), which also helps with cache locality).<br><hr>"
